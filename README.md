**Modified NaMeco Pipeline**

This repository presents my modifications to the amazing NaMeco pipeline (https://github.com/timyerg/NaMeco/), including parameter adjustments and refinements.

The modifications focus primarily on creating a fungal version, fine-tuned for mycological specifics, particularly ITS processing. There is also a bacterial version for 16S data, though it differs only in parameter settings.

For transparency, I acknowledge that among other resources, I utilized Claude AI assistance in refining this pipeline.

Enjoy! ðŸš€
