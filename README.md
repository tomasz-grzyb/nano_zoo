Modified NaMeco Pipeline

This repository presents my modifications to the amazing NaMeco pipeline (https://github.com/timyerg/NaMeco/tree/main), including parameter adjustments and refinements.

The modifications include:

    Optimized parameters for improved detection and classification,
    A specialized fungal version, fine-tuned for mycological data,
    A bacterial version, differing only in parameter settings,
    Refinements made with the help of Claude AI.

Enjoy! ðŸš€
